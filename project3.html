            <div class="column" style="align-items: flex-start;">
                <p>To encounter the world of Green Coding and to get to know their philosophy and commitment to an issue that we initially thought was completely misaligned from us, became a challenge as starting point.<strong> Is there a way to assume a Green Tech behavior in our daily life and our craft in the digital?</strong>
                <br><br>
                    The growing energy use of the Internet surpasses already the energy that all wind and solar power sources worldwide can provide. According to <strong>Solar Low-Tech Magazine</strong> <em>“Running data centers on renewable power sources is not enough to address the growing energy use of the Internet”</em>. Plus, <em>“We were told that the Internet would “dematerialize” society and decrease energy use. Contrary to this projection, it has become a large and rapidly growing consumer of energy itself.”</em>
                <br><br>
                    To align our design decisions to the issue, we decided to dig into the possibilities of reducing the sizes of websites, to generate content that would not become increasingly resource-intensive and have an efficient experience that will decrease the high demand on data traffic (Mb).
                <br><br>
                    The growing importance of videos, which became a trend nowadays, makes the website excessively demanding and heavy. 
                <br><br>
                    We started by adding ethical coordinates such as accessibility, security, sustainability, and reliability; and focus on a layout based on information, readable content, but also fun and self-explaining. The organization of color and graphics becomes very important for the display of content. The amount of information must be delivered logically and predictably. Duotone, black and white contrast, and console design are chosen for usability and as a particular taxonomy that speaks about the product, and still engange a good relationship with the interface and making it functional.
                <br><br>   
                    We try to reduce the cognitive load of choices, show examples of content, organized by tasks, responsive and scalable, and with possibilities to expand the content in the future.
                <br><br>   
                    We defined our user persona, as a 32 years guy that is starting his career as a web developer named Joao. Joao wants to be able to reduce the damage that he does to the environment by working in tech but feels frustrated about not knowing which tools or methods are inside his range of action. He heard about Green Coding and would like to get to know about them and How it works so he can be able to use the Green Metrics Tool and support the cause.
                <br><br>    
                    From here, Joao will approach the website by the following flow: 1. Starting at the Home page to get to know Green Coding and its Community and get interested in knowing about their Green List. 2. Once at the Green List page, Joao will check the Dashboard of the Github Links that have been already provided by other users and measured by Green Coding. This will increase his interest in getting to know about other measurements such as Energy and CPU. 3. He decides to get deeper and check on two different links to enable the Comparison page, where he can see the two links and individual measurements being compared. 4. That's when he decided to check on How it works, to be able to participate and provide a link by himself, read some information about the functionality of the Tool, and see a global picture of the issue that is being taken on.
